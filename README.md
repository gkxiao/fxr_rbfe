# FLARE FEP Case Study
##  Alchemical FEP Prediction of Binding Free Energies for FXR Agonists
This study uses 14 FXR agonists from the D3R CG2 Free Energy Set 2 dataset—whose experimental IC50 values span a range of 1000-fold—as a case to evaluate the performance of Flare/FEP in predicting binding affinities. The results demonstrate an excellent correlation between predicted and experimental values: Kendall Tau = 0.64, Pearson R = 0.90; MUE = 0.35; RMSD = 0.35. The predictions clearly distinguish high-affinity compounds from low-affinity ones. Furthermore, leveraging Cloudam’s cloud computing resources, the entire calculation can be completed within approximately one hour. This illustrates that, with access to virtually unlimited computational resources via cloud platforms, FEP can enable medicinal chemists and computational teams to rapidly and reliably rank structurally similar analogs, thereby accelerating project timelines.
